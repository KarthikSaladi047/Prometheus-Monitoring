In the vast landscape of technology, where systems are dynamic and complexities abound, the need for vigilant oversight has never been more crucial. This is where monitoring and alerting step in as the unsung heroes of digital operations.

![303099163-9bd52ab0-c83f-4967-a1cd-c0964bb71b3b](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/36df7b71-f5ab-4858-bd70-ddf8fb108140)

### Monitoring:üîé
Imagine, your digital infrastructure as a living organism. Monitoring is the constant watchful eye that observes every heartbeat and pulse. It tracks performance metrics, system resource utilization, and the overall well-being of your applications and services. By collecting and analyzing data in real time, monitoring provides a comprehensive view of your system's health.

#### Why Monitoring Matters:
- Proactive Issue Identification: Monitoring allows you to identify potential issues before they escalate into critical problems. By tracking key metrics, you gain insights into trends and anomalies that might indicate potential issues.
- Optimizing Performance: Understanding how your systems perform under different conditions enables you to optimize resources. Monitoring helps you pinpoint bottlenecks, optimize workflows, and ensure efficient resource utilization.
- Enhancing User Experience: Users demand a seamless experience. Monitoring helps you detect and resolve issues that could impact user satisfaction, such as slow response times or service outages.

### Alerting:üö®
Now, imagine monitoring as the watchtower, and alerting as the vigilant guardian that raises the alarm when danger approaches. Alerting takes the insights gained from monitoring and turns them into actionable notifications.

#### Why Alerting Matters:
- Swift Response to Issues: Alerting ensures that the right people are notified immediately when a predefined threshold is breached. This rapid response is crucial for minimizing downtime and mitigating potential damage.
- Preventing Catastrophes: By receiving alerts for abnormal conditions, you can address issues before they escalate into critical failures. This proactive approach is key to preventing catastrophic system failures.
- Maintaining Service Levels: For businesses relying on digital services, maintaining consistent service levels is paramount. Alerting helps you uphold service level agreements (SLAs) and ensures uninterrupted operations.

In summary, monitoring and alerting empower you to maintain reliable, stable services, react swiftly to issues, and make confident changes.üöÄ

## üî≠ Prometheus Architecture

![303097014-42846201-54e4-4090-943f-b88fb78fbfb3](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/e0ea86bb-595a-4a14-9cb1-95015fe8530a)

The major component of the Prometheus is the Prometheus server.

- The Prometheus server contains Retrieval, TSDB and HTTP servers.
- **Retrieval:** It sends the HTTP pull request to the target's endpoints and collects the data (scrapes the metric data).
- **TSDB:** A time series database to store the metric data.
- **HTTP Server:** Exposes an HTTP API for other components to access the metrics stored by Prometheus. Provides a dashboard that is useful for executing metric queries and getting various status info for visualization.
- **Exporters:** Exporter which fetches metrics from targets and coverts to the correct format of Prometheus expects and exposes that data at metrics endpoints.
- **Pushgateway:** It's for short-time lived jobs. A batch workload that shuts down when it has finished its work may not give the metrics to the Prometheus server the chance to collect all metrics before it disappears, the batch workload can push its metrics to the Pushgateway which, in turn, exposes those metrics for the Prometheus server to retrieve.
- **Service discovery:** Service discovery allows us to find the target endpoint to scrape the metrics.
- **Alertmanager:** processes alerts and routes them to receivers that constitute the communication medium to the on-call engineers.
- **PromQL:** It is a powerful query language used for querying. It allows users to retrieve, filter, aggregate and transform metrics to gain insights into system performance and behaviour. PromQL query expression which used to set the alert rule for the alerting system.
_ **Data Visualization:** Help in the visualization of metrics data into graphs and other forms. Grafana is an open-source visualization layer that has become the default solution for viewing Prometheus metrics.

```
- Add the following and save the file.
```
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus Alertmanager
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=alertmanager
Group=alertmanager
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/etc/alertmanager/
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/alertmanager

```
sudo systemctl status alertmanager
```
![302143739-ec395c3d-c88a-4834-8099-c6055ad7c134](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/f6c8b219-c5d6-47ec-b12b-a3e0485760d8)

- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9093. You should see the Alert Manager web interface.

![302143780-d8e851e1-83e8-4718-b325-0848c9be084b](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/8f86b0d1-da04-4284-a9d4-92e9e8ec8abc)

### Step 4: Define Alerting Rules:

- create a /etc/prometheus/rules1.yml configuration file to add alerting rules.
```
groups:
- name: alerts_1
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPULoad
    expr: 100 - (avg(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100) > 90
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: page
    annotations:
      summary: High CPU Load
  - alert: LowMemory
    expr: (avg(node_memory_MemFree_bytes) / avg(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)) * 100 < 10
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: page
    annotations:
      summary: Low Memory
```
In the above example:

- HighCPULoad: Triggers an alert if the CPU usage is above 90% for more than 5 minutes.

- LowMemory: Triggers an alert if the available memory is below 10% for more than 5 minutes.

### Step 5: Configure Alerts:

- Prometheus can send alerts to Alertmanager, which then handles the notifications. Update your /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml to include the Alertmanager configuration:
```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'prometheus'

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']

rule_files:
  - rules1.yml

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - localhost:9093
```
- now restart Prometheus, so that the new configuration will be applied.
```
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```
### Step 6: Set up Alertmanager:

Update the /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml file with basic configurations. For simplicity, let's use a simple notification through email. Add the following to your alertmanager.yml:

```
global:
  smtp_smarthost: 'smtp.example.com:587'
  smtp_from: 'alertmanager@example.com'
  smtp_auth_username: 'alertmanager@example.com'
  smtp_auth_password: 'your_email_password'

route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'job']

receivers:
- name: 'email-notifier'
  email_configs:
  - to: 'your-email@example.com'
```
Replace placeholders with your actual email server details.

- now restart Alert Manager, so that the new configuration will be applied.
```
sudo systemctl restart alertmanger
``` 
### Step 7: Test the Alerts:

To test the alerts, you can manually trigger them. For example, stress your system to simulate high CPU usage or low memory conditions.
```
sudo apt-get install stress
stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 2 --timeout 1000
```
Refer: https://pkgs.org/download/stress

### Step 8: View Alerts:

- Access the Prometheus web interface at http://localhost:9090 and You should see active alerts and their status.

![302149774-3f68a58a-5a0a-4683-ae96-d9b7545b6610](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/415a39af-e2a2-46b4-956c-c72c2c4f5fe4)

```
### Step 3: Configure Prometheus:

- Edit the prometheus.yml file in the ~/etc/prometheus/ directory. Use a text editor like Nano or Vim:

```
vim /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```
- Add the following configuration to prometheus.yml to add docker as a scraping target for Prometheus:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'prometheus'

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
  - job_name: 'docker'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9323']

rule_files:
  - rules1.yml

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - localhost:9093
```
- We need to restart Prometheus so that the new configuration will be applied.
```
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```
### Step 4: Verify Docker Metrics:

- Check if the Docker is publishing its metrics on port 9323. Navigate to localhost:9323/metrics

```
- Add the following configuration to prometheus.yml to add push_gateway as a scraping target for Prometheus:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'prometheus'

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:

rule_files:
  - rules1.yml

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - localhost:9093
```
- We need to restart Prometheus so that the new configuration will be applied.
```
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```
### Step 4: Verify Push Gateway:

- Check if the Push Gateway is running.
```
sudo systemctl status pushgateway
```
![303860474-d125049f-b241-4ecd-8252-3ecb1fe2bd1b](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/312b530b-0447-4d0d-ad92-0d9abf600a00)

- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9091. You should see the Push Gateway web interface.
  
![303860927-d10261e0-9ab5-4b74-a5c3-3ad940d8e875](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/93a7cbfc-9e44-4662-875e-f47f24683c26)

### Step 5: Register metrics to Push Gateway:

- Create a Python script using the Prometheus Python Client Library that pushes metrics to Push Gateway.
```
cd ~/Pushgateway
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install prometheus-client
vim push_register.py
---
from prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, push_to_gateway

registry = CollectorRegistry()

g = Gauge('job_last_success_unixtime', 'Last time a batch job successfully finished', registry=registry)

g.set_to_current_time()

push_to_gateway('localhost:9091', job='batchA', registry=registry)
```
Refer: https://prometheus.github.io/client_python/exporting/pushgateway/

- Create a cron job that runs every 5 minutes. It creates a temporary file using mktemp, then executes the Python script push_register.py using Python 3, and discards any output or error messages generated by the script.
```
crontab -e
2
--
*/5 * * * * /bin/mktemp /tmp/push-XXXXX && /usr/bin/python3 /home/$USER/Pushgateway/push_register.py > /dev/null 2>&1
```
### Step 6: Verify metrics at Push Gateway:

- Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9114. In the Push Gateway web interface, you should see the Metrics that are pushed by the Python script.

![303863385-b371d178-3392-45e7-b120-2acaef9ddf78](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/b7cbc1eb-f7c4-4102-ba4c-a751fd69a461)

- We can also see the metrics available in Prometheus.

## üîü Service Discovery:

- Prometheus has multiple methods to discover services to monitor. You can use static configuration, Kubernetes, discovery via DNS SRV records, files with targets listed in them, and Hashicorp‚Äôs Consul.
- Prometheus can also use the APIs of some cloud providers to discover services.

In this project, we will cover File-Based Service Discovery.
- If you need to use a service discovery system that is not currently supported, your use case may be best served by Prometheus' file-based service discovery mechanism, which enables you to list scrape targets in a JSON/YAML file (along with metadata about those targets).
Refer: https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/

### Step 1: Configure Prometheus for Service Discovery:

- Edit the prometheus.yml file in the /etc/prometheus/ directory. Use a text editor like Nano or Vim:

```
vim /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```
- Add the following configuration to prometheus.yml to add a target called service_discovery that uses the File-Based Service Discovery:
```
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'prometheus'

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
  - job_name: 'docker'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9323']
  - job_name: 'blackbox_dns'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module:
        - dns_google
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['8.8.8.8']
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115
  - job_name: 'redflag-sale-status'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module:
        - http_redflagdeals
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['https://www.redflagdeals.com']
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115
  - job_name: 'push_gateway'
    honor_labels: true
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9091']
  - job_name: 'service_discovery'
    file_sd_configs:
    - files:
      - '/etc/prometheus/targets.json'

rule_files:
  - rules1.yml

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - localhost:9093
```
- We need to restart Prometheus so that the new configuration will be applied.
```
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```
- Until we add a target in the targets.json file, we won't see the service_discovery target in the Prometheus UI.

![303865469-de7f527a-45a9-4c94-b3fd-31942e6c40bc](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/9b2536fd-89b4-4f24-ac03-58b8a7a881c8)

### Step 2: Adding Targets Dynamically:

- Create a targets.json file in the /etc/prometheus/ directory and add the below content.
```
vim /etc/prometheus/targets.json
--
[
  {
    "labels": {
      "job": "grafana"
    },
    "targets": [
      "localhost:3000"
    ]
  }
]
```
- Prometheus automatically reloads the targets.json file periodically (by default every 5 minutes), so changes take effect without needing a manual restart of any service.
  
![303865731-3a87e280-29ca-49da-999a-d50f4b3f7759](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/673d27ed-4766-4968-bbae-0e2f2c626945)

- Add one more target.
```
vim /etc/prometheus/targets.json
--
[
  {
    "labels": {
      "job": "grafana"
    },
    "targets": [
      "localhost:3000"
    ]
  },
  {
    "labels": {
      "job": "alert_manager"
    },
    "targets": [
      "localhost:9093"
    ]
  }
]
```
- Now you can see 2 Endpoints under the service_discovery target.

![303865885-ca802eb9-380f-420d-ac4e-74d4e11dc69b](https://github.com/KarthikSaladi047/Prometheus-Monitoring/assets/105864615/e8c2d833-e077-4c9a-8e50-946cc2efa7a5)

Note: Mostly Ansible is used to generate the target JSON/YAML files that contain the list of VMs & Services that are scrapping targets for Prometheus. So that Prometheus will take targets from that file dynamically.
